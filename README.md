# Simple Autodiff

## Overview

This is a simple package for automatic differentiation. It is not meant to be performant and is instead meant to illustrate the simplicity and power of auto diff. This package is built on top of numpy and is inspired by the autograd engine in pytorch. I decided to code this because in my ML class, we are not supposed to use pytorch, so I coded this myself so I can use autodiff without getting into trouble. 

The `./autodiff` folder contains the main code for the package. The `./examples` folder contains examples of how you could use the package. The `./tests` folder contains tests to verify that the autodiff calculations are correct.
